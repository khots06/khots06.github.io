# kyCollegeSelector
This page is meant to help users find colleges in Kentucky that are best fit for them based on a series of questions.  The user can select up-to 4 different radio buttons and the colleges that meet the criteria of the selections will display.  I used flexbox in three different areas: photo and intro text; the questions; and the multiple lists of colleges.  I used the nth-child(even) to style the lists of colleges to alter the background color.  I used javascript onchange to run functions that will display and hide content based on the radio buttons selected.  There is also a Reset button that will deselect all buttons, hides all questions except for the first question, and hides all colleges.  The webpage can be viewed here: https://khots06.github.io/
